This Project we made for doing practice of Java DataBase Connectivity using MYSQL ,
HOTEL RESERVATION SYSTEM : There is five operation we performed in this particular project that we are mention below 
1.  Reservation Room       (for achieve this we have writing a method which help to reserve room by taking some information like reserveId , name ,room_number , contact date and time !)
2.  Review the Reservation (how many room or how many guest using hotel for specific range of time . so basically Retrieving data from database )
3.  Get Room Number        (here we want to know the room number of any guest , they are using for living ) 
4.  Update Reservation     (here we want to Update the database ob leaving the guest and on comeing new guest )
5.  Deleting the reservation  ( here we want to delete the data from the table or database ) 
6.  Exiting the System at last after using .

So my Database table structure/schema design as hotel_reservation in my System , in this one table made that is Reservation name .
there is field of database containing the ,
1st reservation ID for uniquely identify any room or guest on allocating the room it is autoincrement , 2nd is Guest name varchar not null 3rd is room number not null integer type
4th is Contact number it is also varchar and not null , 5th is Date and time whenever room allocated that time and date specified so it is Timestamp  .
Database schema designed as like this , 
CREATE TABLE Reservation(
    res_ID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    guest_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    room_number INT NOT NULL,
    contact VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    res_DATE TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
    );

here  our database designed , Now move on the COnnection Establising between database and java 
******/
/******
we are loading the JDBC Drivers by using them we can connect java with the database , here getting the DriverManager 
by providing it's getconnection has  method url , username and password so that we can establish the Connection !
after that we wrote the switch statement for calling the that 6 function 
 in while loop for perform operations using java database connectivity .
 and also we used exception Hendling in this project using try and catch also throws . we are handling exception every time in this particular project .
 we used for CRUD Operation , in database table at inserting time we are Iserting the data for reserving room this is done in reserveRoom () method 
 here we create a statement and using this statement we are able to execute the SQL Inserting Query in table , using executeUpdate method in connection .
 we are reading or taking data from user aso use Scanner class . 
 for Better secure storing data in database we are using in JDBC preparedStatement so we can avoid the SQL injection .

 and then we are reviewing the data  from database using viewReservation() method ,for getting or read retrieving data
 getRoomNumber() Method for the getting Room number of any particular Guest using Primary key Res_ID and guest_name .
 for doing Updating Database when any guest leaving and coming new guest so we can allocate them easly , that thing achieve by updateReservation , 
 before updating we need to check for the existing Primary key , or which res_id has not any guest detail and any guest gone and other come , 
 before allocating them we need to check if any room available or not so checking this we wrote aa function that is existReservation is it exist then we can update it 
 for new guest .

 when we need to delete the entry or row of database we can use parmanentaly delete using DeleteReservation() Method  .

 at the end of the system we are going exit so after perform task system will shutdown .

Hey Connection ,I hope you all are doing Extremely well in your #upskilling Journey (DSA and Development or others ).

I am doing right now Java Backend Learning .I upskilling myself in Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) ,How java Interact with Database internally and perform task and operation in real world ,i understand the working of that and technologies .Using JDBC we made a project that is...

🔹 Project: Hotel Reservation System -> https://github.com/ayushraj9725/JDBC-Projects-/tree/master/src/Hotel_Resarvation

🔹 Technologies: Java, MySQL, JDBC, SQL

This project is a hands-on practice application to learn and apply Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) with MySQL in the context of a hotel reservation system. The system performs essential CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

🔶  Key Features:

1. Room Reservation: Allows users to reserve a room by entering guest details, room number, contact information, and timestamp.

2. View Reservations: Retrieves and displays all current reservations, showing how many rooms are booked and guest details for a specific time range.

3. Get Room Number: Fetches the room number for a particular guest using their reservation ID.

4. Update Reservation: Enables modification of guest details or room allocation when guests leave or new guests arrive, ensuring smooth room turnover.

5. Delete Reservation: Deletes a reservation from the database when it's no longer needed.

6. System Exit: Cleanly exits the system after completing all tasks.

🔷 Database Schema :

i designed  schema in form of table inside the hotel_reservation database that exist in my system.

Each reservation has a unique ID (res_ID),guest name,room number,contact

and a timestamp for when the room was allocated.

👨‍💻 Technical Details:

🔸 JDBC Connection: Establishes a secure connection to the MySQL database using DriverManager.getConnection(), leveraging prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.

🔸 Exception Handling: Manages potential errors with try-catch blocks to ensure smooth operation and prevent unexpected crashes.

🔸 Switch Statements and Loops: Implements a user-friendly menu using a while loop and switch statements, allowing for continuous operations until the user chooses to exit.

🔸 Prepared Statements: Used for better data security and to prevent SQL injection when executing SQL queries

🔦 what we gain and why this ? 

This project strengthened my understanding of Java's JDBC API, SQL operations, and best practices for database interaction. I gained hands-on experience with CRUD operations, exception handling, and writing SQL queries to manage relational data effectively.

This project has been a valuable experience in learning database interaction with Java and demonstrates practical skills in backend development. Looking forward to applying these skills to more complex real-world applications!



Hey ,if you really want to upskill together surely connect ! ThankYou 😊
